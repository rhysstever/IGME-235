## Brick Pong Proposal
When Brick Breaker meets Pong, your oppenent's bumper is no longer your only obstacle.

### Genre
Strategy, Sports (if that mode is implemented)

### Platform
Desktop at first, with mobile as a stretch goal.

### Story
The two oppenents are rivals, battling to prove they are the best. If the "sports mode" is implemented, the players are rival teams, fighting for the tournament trophy.

### Aesthetics
A retro aesthetic using an 8-bit art design. The default colors will be vibrant, similar to Tetris.
A stretch goal will be to add different "modes" that will change the aesthetic to look like a soccer field.

### Gameplay
Brick Pong is a 2-player game. The objective is to hit the projectile with your bumper past the opposing player's bumper into their goal. Player 1's goal and bumper will be displayed on the left and Player 2's on the right.
Blocks are spawned in between goals and players can break them to release powerups. Powerups include: multiball, faster bumper speed, and slower opponent bumper speed.
